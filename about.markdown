Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/sijielan/Hello-World/raw/master/sijie__CV.pdf)  



I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Xiamen University and my supervisor is [*Prof. Suzhen Wu.*](https://astl.xmu.edu.cn/)

My research interests cover flash memory and NVM. These researches focus on the structure and error characteristics of storage media to propose methods to improve performance and reliability. Another research direction combines storage media with other storage techniques, such as deduplication system. One ongoing work focuses on the performance and reliability study of 3D flash memory. Our objective is to improve the performance of flash memory by utilizing the characteristics of 3D-NAND memory, such as data allocation,garbage collection, error correction codes, etc.

  Each cell in NAND flash memory contains kinds of threshold voltages to store corresponding bit information. By analyzing characteristics of different threshold voltages and amounts of files in the real world, the cells’ bits information with higher threshold voltages is more likely to leak their electrons to arise bit errors. Based on thisobservation, we proposed a method called BitFlip, which minimizes the number of the state with higher states to achieve better performance.
