## ABOUT ME
---

My research interests cover flash memory and NVM. These researches focus on the structure and error characteristics of storage media to propose methods to improve performance and reliability. Another research direction combines storage media with other storage techniques, such as deduplication system. One ongoing work focuses on the performance and reliability study of 3D flash memory. Our objective is to improve the performance of flash memory by utilizing the characteristics of 3D-NAND memory, such as data allocation,garbage collection, error correction codes, etc.

**BitFlip: A Bit-Flipping Scheme for Reducing Read Latency and Improving Reliability of Flash Memory**


I created the idea and designed the system.Each cell in NAND flash memory contains kinds of threshold voltages to store corresponding bit information. By analyzing characteristics of different threshold voltages and amounts of files in the real world, the cells' bits information with higher threshold voltages is more likely to leak their electrons to arise bit errors. Based on thisobservation, we proposed a method called BitFlip, which minimizes the number of the state with higher threshold voltage to achieve better performance. 

In this work, ***my main contributions*** are as follows:


1.Read and analyze related research on flash memory and propose a method called BitFlip.

2.Test the performance of this method on the SSDsim simulation platform.

3.Write the first draft of the paper based on the results of the experiment.

The paper of this work has been accepted by ***MSST'2020***
